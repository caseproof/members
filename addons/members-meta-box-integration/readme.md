# Members - Meta Box Integration

The Members - Meta Box Integration add-on more nicely integrates the [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/) plugin capabilities into the Members plugin's role manager.

The [Members plugin](https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) and the Meta Box plugin are required to be installed and activated for this plugin to work.

## Meta Box Role Group

The plugin creates a new role group for Meta Box, which is located under the Users > Roles screen in the admin.  This role group lists the following roles:

- Customer
- Any other roles that have Meta Box-related capabilities.

This allows you to see any roles that have Meta Box permissions at a glance.

## Meta Box Capability Group

When editing or creating a new role in Members, this add-on creates a new "MetaBox" tab (cap group).  This tab combines all of the Meta Box capabilities in one place.  That way, you can see all available caps without jumping between different tabs.

# Members - GiveWP Integration

The Members - GiveWP Integration add-on more nicely integrates the [GiveWP](https://givewp.com/) and [GiveWP Recurring Donations](https://givewp.com/addons/recurring-donations/) plugin capabilities into the Members plugin's role manager.

The [Members plugin](https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) and the GiveWP plugin are required to be installed and activated for this plugin to work.  The Recurring Donations plugin is optional.

## GiveWP Role Group

The plugin creates a new role group for GiveWP, which is located under the Users > Roles screen in the admin.  This role group lists the following roles:

- Give Accountant
- Give Donor (_Recurring Donations_ extension)
- Give Manager
- Give Subscriber
- Give Worker
- Any other roles that have GiveWP-related capabilities.

This allows you to see any roles that have GiveWP permissions at a glance.

## GiveWP Capability Group

When editing or creating a new role in Members, this add-on creates a new GiveWP tab (cap group).  This tab combines all of the GiveWP capabilities in one place.  That way, you can see all available caps without jumping between different tabs.

Add-on plugin for Members for hierarchical user roles.

== Description ==

Members - Role Hierarchy is an add-on plugin for the [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members), which adds a hierarchical role system.

Hierarchical roles are important when you want to allow "lower" level users, such as Editors, to create, edit, promote, or delete users without giving them access to a higher role, such as Administrator.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why was this plugin created?

A hierarchical role system is one of the most-requested features that I've gotten over the years from Members' users.  Fortunately, an awesome client had me build this add-on and allowed me to release it back for free to the community.

### How do I use it?

Most things should be fairly straightforward if you've used Members, but I've included an in-depth guide in the plugin download.  It's a file called `readme.md` in the plugin folder.

You can also [view the readme](https://github.com/justintadlock/members-role-hierarchy/blob/master/readme.md) online.

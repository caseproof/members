# Members Subscriptions Template Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive template system implemented to fix the 404 errors with product pages.

## Template System Overview

The Members Subscriptions plugin now includes a multi-layered template system with fallbacks to ensure products always display properly:

1. **WordPress Template Hierarchy** - Root level template files that follow WordPress's standard naming conventions:
   - `/single-members_product.php` - For single product display
   - `/archive-members_product.php` - For product archives

2. **Theme Override System** - Templates can be overridden in the theme's directory structure:
   - `members/subscriptions/single-product.php`
   - `members/single-product.php`
   - `members-subscriptions/single-product.php`

3. **Plugin Templates Directory** - Default templates provided in the plugin's templates directory:
   - `/templates/single-product.php`
   - `/templates/archive-product.php`

4. **Direct Rendering** - Last resort fallback that renders products directly:
   - Uses inline HTML and styling to ensure content is always displayed
   - Fetches product data even when templates are missing

## URL Handling Improvements

The template system includes several improvements to handle product URLs:

1. **404 Rescue Mechanism** - Added a special handler that detects 404s and attempts to recover:
   - Intercepts 404 responses for URLs that match the product patterns
   - Retrieves the correct product data based on the URL path
   - Sets up the proper query and global variables

2. **Enhanced Rewrite Rules** - Improved post type registration:
   - Added endpoint mask support (`EP_PERMALINK | EP_PAGES`)
   - Ensured slug settings are correct
   - Added rewrite rules flushing on activation and version changes

3. **Product Query Enhancement** - Added filters and actions to improve product queries:
   - Ensures correct pagination and sorting in archives
   - Loads the proper templates based on context
   - Adds body classes for better styling support

## Debugging Tools

For easier debugging of template issues, the following tools are included:

1. **Debug Logging** - Extensive error_log statements to track template loading:
   - Shows which template is being loaded
   - Indicates which fallback mechanism is being used
   - Logs 404 recovery attempts

2. **Flush Rules Utility** - A standalone utility to manually flush rules:
   - `/flush-rules.php` - Load this file directly to force rules flushing
   - Displays current product links after flushing for easy testing
   - Provides troubleshooting steps if issues persist

## Common Issues and Solutions

If you still experience 404 errors after these improvements:

1. Go to WordPress Settings â†’ Permalinks and click "Save Changes" (without changing anything)
2. Visit the flush-rules.php utility by accessing it directly in your browser
3. Check that your theme supports custom post types properly
4. Enable WP_DEBUG for more detailed error information

## Technical Implementation

The improvements are implemented in several key files:

- `src/class-template-loader.php` - Core template handling class
- `src/Plugin.php` - Post type registration with enhanced settings
- `single-members_product.php` - Root level template file
- `archive-members_product.php` - Root level archive template
- `templates/single-product.php` - Template directory version
- `templates/archive-product.php` - Template directory version
- `flush-rules.php` - Rewrite rules utility

All templates include responsive styling and display product meta data correctly.

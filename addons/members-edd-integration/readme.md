# Members - EDD Integration

The Members - EDD Integration add-on more nicely integrates the [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) plugin capabilities into the Members plugin's role manager.

The [Members plugin](https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) and the Easy Digital Downloads plugin are required to be installed and activated for this plugin to work.

## Shop Role Group

The plugin creates a new "Shop" role group for Easy Digital Downloads, which is located under the Users > Roles screen in the admin.  This role group lists the following roles:

- Shop Accountant
- Shop Manager
- Shop Vendor
- Shop Worker
- Any other roles that have EDD-related capabilities.

This allows you to see any roles that have EDD permissions at a glance.

## Downloads Capability Group

When editing or creating a new role in Members, this add-on creates a new "Downloads" tab (cap group).  This tab combines all of the Easy Digital Downloads capabilities in one place.  That way, you can see all available caps without jumping between different tabs.

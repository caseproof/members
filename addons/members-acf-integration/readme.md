# Members - ACF Integration

The Members - ACF Integration add-on creates custom capabilities for the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://advancedcustomfields.com) (ACF) plugin for managing with the Members plugin.

The [Members plugin](https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) and the ACF plugin are required to be installed and activated for this plugin to work.  The Recurring Donations plugin is optional.

## ACF Role Group

The plugin creates a new role group called "Advanced Custom Fields," which is located under the Users > Roles screen in the admin.  This role group lists any roles that have ACF-related capabilities.

## ACF Capability Group

When editing or creating a new role in Members, this add-on creates a new "Custom Fields" tab (cap group).  This tab combines all of the ACF capabilities in one place.  That way, you can see all available caps without jumping between different tabs.

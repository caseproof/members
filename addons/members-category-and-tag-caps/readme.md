# Members - Category and Tag Caps

The Category and Tag Caps add-on creates custom capabilities for the core category and post tag taxonomies.  This allows site owners to have precise control over who can manage, edit, delete, or assign categories/tags.

The plugin creates the following capabilities, which can be managed from the edit role screen.

- **Categories:**
	- `manage_categories` - Allows access to the Posts > Categories admin screen.
	- `edit_categories` - Allows users to edit categories.
	- `delete_categories` - Allows users to delete categories.
	- `assign_categories` - Allows users to assign categories to posts.
- **Tags:**
	- `manage_post_tags` - Allows access to the Posts > Tags admin screen.
	- `edit_post_tags` - Allows users to edit tags.
	- `delete_post_tags` - Allows users to delete tags.
	- `assign_post_tags` - Allows users to assign tags to posts.

The [Members WordPress plugin](https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) is required to be installed and activated for this plugin to work.
